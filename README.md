# Results and Challenges

## Results
This study analyzed the **Baltimore City Employee Salaries** dataset to uncover trends in salary distribution, agency pay variations, and hiring patterns. Below are the key findings:

### Salary Distribution
- The majority of employees have an annual salary within a specific range, with some outliers earning significantly higher.
- The **histogram of annual salaries** reveals a skewed distribution, indicating a larger number of employees earning lower salaries compared to high-income earners.

### Gross Pay by Agency
- There is **considerable variation in gross pay** across different agencies.
- Certain agencies have a **higher average gross pay**, likely due to job roles, seniority, or overtime compensation.
- **Top-paying agencies** were identified using bar plots and summary statistics.

### Hiring Trends
- The **year with the highest number of hirings** was identified through time-series analysis.
- Significant **fluctuations in hiring trends** were observed, with notable spikes in specific years.
- Potential reasons for hiring trends include **budget allocations, policy changes, or workforce demands**.

### Salary vs. Gross Pay (Linear Regression)
- A **strong correlation between annual salary and gross pay** was observed.
- However, **some deviations exist**, possibly due to **bonuses, overtime, or additional compensations**.



## Challenges
While conducting this analysis, several challenges were encountered:

### **Data Cleaning**
- **Missing values** in key fields such as hire dates and salary data required preprocessing.
- **Inconsistent date formats** had to be standardized before extracting hiring year information.

### **Handling Large Data**
- The dataset contained a large number of entries, requiring **efficient SQL queries** for summary statistics.
- **Performance issues** were encountered when processing large-scale visualizations in R and Tableau.

### **Data Interpretation Challenges**
- Some employees had **higher gross pay than their annual salaries**, likely due to **bonuses, overtime, or allowances**.
- Interpreting hiring trends required **contextual insights**, such as policy changes affecting recruitment.

### **Visualization Constraints**
- **Tableauâ€™s multivariate analysis required significant optimization** for clear and insightful visualizations.
- **Limited granularity in agency-level data** made it difficult to fully explain salary variations.
